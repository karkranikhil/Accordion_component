# Accordion_component
there are two main types of components you usually create, and different people give name them differently:

smart components / stateful components - These are components that coordinate a set of “dumb component”. 
They connect with Angular services, fetch data or get invoked through routings.
dumb components / stateless components - These are responsible for the immediate visual feedback. 
They define input bindings and callbacks and render the data they receive. Usually they’re not necessarily coupled to the application and are highly reusable.
